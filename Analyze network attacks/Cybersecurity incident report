Cybersecurity Incident Report

Section 1: Identify the type of attack that may have caused this 
network interruption
One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error message is overload in web server may be the reason of error in site

The logs show that so many TCP SYN requests are getting from unfamiliar IP addresses.

This event could be done to down the server of our company.





Section 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction
When website visitors try to establish a connection with the web server, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol. Explain the three steps of the handshake:
Firstly, the client establishes the connection with the server. By sending SYN packets.

Then server responds to those packets by sending SYN-ACK packets 

Then the client sends the ACK packets to the server to establish the stable connection in continuity.

Explain what happens when a malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets all at once: The server gets overwhelmed and acts abnormally and unable to respond.

Explain what the logs indicate and how that affects the server: log indicates that the packet received are from unfamiliar IP addresses and the server could not take that much amount of request at a time.
